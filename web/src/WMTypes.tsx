            Fixed TV Wall Mounts
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            Fixed TV wall mounts are the simplest and most affordable option.
            They securely attach your TV to the wall, providing a flush and
            stationary appearance. These mounts are ideal for rooms where the
            viewing angle doesn't need to be adjusted frequently. They are easy
            to install and offer a clean, low-profile look that complements
            modern interior designs.

            Tilt TV Wall Mounts
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            Tilt TV wall mounts provide a bit more flexibility compared to fixed
            mounts. With a tilting mechanism, you can angle the TV vertically to
            reduce glare or achieve a better viewing angle. Tilt mounts are
            suitable for mounting TVs above eye level or in rooms with varying
            lighting conditions. They strike a balance between a sleek
            appearance and enhanced adjustability.

            Articulating (Swivel or Full-Motion) TV Wall Mounts
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            For those seeking the ultimate flexibility, articulating TV wall
            mounts are the way to go. These mounts allow you to swivel, tilt,
            and extend your TV, providing a wide range of viewing options.
            Articulating mounts are perfect for larger rooms or open-concept
            spaces where you might need to adjust the viewing angle based on
            your seating arrangement. They are also popular for corner
            installations, as they allow the TV to be pulled out and angled
            towards the center of the room.

            Ceiling TV Mounts
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            While less common than wall mounts, ceiling TV mounts can be a
            unique and practical choice. Ideal for rooms with limited wall space
            or unconventional layouts, ceiling mounts suspend the TV from above.
            This option is often chosen for commercial settings, such as bars,
            restaurants, or gyms. Ceiling mounts provide an overhead viewing
            experience and can be adjusted to achieve the desired height and
            angle.

            Motorized TV Wall Mounts
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            For the tech enthusiasts and those who appreciate a touch of luxury,
            motorized TV wall mounts offer the convenience of remote-controlled
            movement. With the press of a button, you can adjust the position
            and angle of your TV, creating a dynamic and futuristic viewing
            experience. While pricier than manual mounts, motorized options
            bring a touch of sophistication to your home entertainment setup.
